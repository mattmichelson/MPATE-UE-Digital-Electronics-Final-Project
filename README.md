# MIDI Clap Sequencer
You're there with your DAW open, ready to make music. You think of a drum rhythm in your head but 30 minutes pass by and you're still programming the perfect rhythm! Here is where my project, the MIDI clap-rhythm sequencer, comes in handy. You no longer have to go through the tedious process of dragging and clicking to get the perfect rhythm. My project allows you to record rhythms by clappingÂ into an adjustable 16-step sequencer. Want to store multiple rhythms? My project has 16 channels that you could easily write to. When you want to send these rhythms to your DAW, simply stop recording, press record on your DAW, and consider the job done. Do you want to make the rhythm faster or slower? Just turn the blue knob. You don't like what you recorded? Press the top right button to clear the current channel or the bottom middle button to clear all channels. Do you want to play your rhythm in reverse? Just flip the switch! The MIDI clap-rhythm sequencer would be a very useful asset in any studio.
